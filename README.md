# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This is a place where I've been pushing my solutions to DS&A problems! I treat this repo as my accountability buddy to ensure that I push code every day. PRACTICE MAKES... better

## How It's Done:

**Approach:** All solutions are in JS

I began studying DS&A after reading [Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms) from [The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/series/mit-press-essential-knowledge-series). I initially picked this book up at Elliott Bay Bookstore in Seattle because I felt uncomfortable with creating eloquent solutions to complex problems in CS. This book showed me how interesting algorithms can be! Now I do my daily algorithm in order to keep this part of my brain sharp. My mom does sodoku in the morning; I solve algorithms.

## Optimizations

I always try to solve these problems with optimal time complexity. Besides that, a way to optimize my **learning** has been with the PREP method. Instead of putting my head down and attempting to solve each problem immediatley, I write out the parameters / edge cases, expected returns, examples of how a solution would process the information given, and then finally solve the problem with pseudo code. This methodology helps me to cement best practices and solidify my knowledge on certain data structures.

## Lessons Learned:

I'd say my biggest lesson learned is that the **process** of solving these problems is most fulfilling. Yes, it is good to become better at DS&A for interviews, but it is also okay to not **absolutely grind** through these problems in anguish.

## Examples:

Feel free to dig in the repo to see which problems I have solved!
